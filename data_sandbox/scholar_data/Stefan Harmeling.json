    "Description": "We study the problem of object classification when training and test classes are disjoint, i.e. no training examples of the target classes are available. This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new \u2026",

This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the \u2026",

    "Description": "Image denoising can be described as the problem of mapping from a noisy image to a noise-free image. The best currently available denoising methods approximate this mapping with cleverly engineered algorithms. In this work we attempt to learn this mapping directly with a plain multi layer perceptron (MLP) applied to image patches. While this has been done before, we will show that by training on large image databases we are able to compete with the current state-of-the-art image denoising methods. Furthermore, our approach is easily adapted to less extensively studied types of noise (by merely exchanging the training data), for which we achieve excellent results as well.",

Thus, we get an answer to the question what is the most likely label of a given unseen data point. However, most methods will provide no answer why the model predicted a particular label for a single instance and what features were most influential for that particular instance. The only method that is currently able to provide such explanations are decision trees. This paper proposes a procedure which (based on a set of assumptions) allows to explain the decisions of any classification method.",

State-of-the-art methods for removing camera shake model the blur as a linear combination of homographically transformed versions of the true image.

In this paper we develop a forward model based on the efficient filter flow framework, incorporating the particularities of camera shake, and show how an efficient algorithm for blur removal can be obtained. Comprehensive comparisons on a number of real-world blurry images show that our approach is not only substantially faster, but it also leads to better deblurring results.",

Single image blind deconvolution (BD) or motion deblurring aims at restoring a sharp latent image from the blurred recorded picture without knowing the camera motion that took place during the exposure. BD is a long-standing problem, but has attracted much attention recently, cumulating in several algorithms able to restore photos degraded by real camera motion in high quality. In this paper, we present a benchmark dataset for motion deblurring that allows quantitative performance evaluation and comparison of recent approaches featuring non-uniform blur models. To this end, we record and analyse real camera motion, which is played back on a robot platform such that we can record a sequence of sharp images sampling the six dimensional camera motion trajectory.

Key assumptions are that the kernel feature space is chosen rich enough to approximate the nonlinearity and that signals of interest contain temporal information. Both assumptions are fulfilled for a wide set of real-world applications. The algorithm works as follows: First, the data are (implicitly) mapped to a high (possibly infinite)\u2014dimensional kernel feature space. In practice, however, the data form a smaller submanifold in feature space\u2014even smaller than the number of training data points\u2014a fact that has already been used by, for example, reduced set techniques for support vector machines.

    "Description": "Image deconvolution is the ill-posed problem of recovering a sharp image, given a blurry one generated by a convolution. In this work, we deal with space-invariant nonblind deconvolution. Currently, the most successful methods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step approach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network. We will show that this approach outperforms the current state-ofthe-art on a large dataset of artificially blurred images. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method in a real-world example with photographic out-of-focus blur.",

And (iii), we present an experimental setup for evaluation that allows us to take images with real camera shake while at the same time record the space-variant point spread function corresponding to that blur. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is able to deblur images degraded by spatially-varying blur originating from real camera shake.",

    "Description": "The development of probabilistic inference techniques has made considerable progress in recent years, in particular with respect to exploiting the structure (eg, factored, hierarchical or relational) of discrete and continuous problem domains. We show that these techniques can be used also for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or partial observable MDPs (POMDPs) when formulated in terms of a structured dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The approach is based on an equivalence between maximization of the expected future return in the time-unlimited MDP and likelihood maximization in a related mixture of finite-time MDPs. This allows us to use expectation maximization (EM) for computing optimal policies, using arbitrary inference techniques in the E-step. Unlike previous approaches we can show that this actually optimizes the discounted expected future return for arbitrary reward functions and without assuming an ad hoc finite total time.\nWe first develop the approach for standard MDPs and demonstrate it using exact inference on a discrete maze and Gaussian belief state propagation in non-linear stochastic optimal control problems. Then we present an extension for solving POMDPs. We consider an agent model that includes an internal memory variable used for gating reactive behaviors. Using exact inference on the respective DBN, the EM-algorithm solves complex maze problems by learning appropriate internal memory representations.",

We find that positive and negative GPP extremes occurring on 7% of the spatiotemporal domain explain 78% of the global interannual variation in GPP and a significant fraction of variation in the net carbon flux. The largest thousand negative GPP extremes during 1982\u20132011 (4.3% of the data) account for a decrease in photosynthetic carbon uptake of about 3.5 Pg C yr\u2212 1, with most events being attributable to water scarcity.

    "Description": "We propose two methods that reduce the post-nonlinear blind source separation problem (PNL-BSS) to a linear BSS problem. The first method is based on the concept of maximal correlation: we apply the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) algorithm---a powerful technique from non-parametric statistics---to approximately invert the componentwise non-linear functions. The second method is a Gaussianizing transformation, which is motivated by the fact that linearly mixed signals before nonlinear transformation are approximately Gaussian distributed. This heuristic, but simple and efficient procedure works as good as the ACE method. Using the framework provided by ACE, convergence can be proven. The optimal transformations obtained by ACE coincide with the sought-after inverse functions of the nonlinearities.

As a consequence, we need to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies, while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a methodological framework that firstly detects spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and easily applicable to a variety of data sets with different spatial \u2026",

Mosseri et al. [11] distinguish between internal and external methods depending whether they exploit internal or external statistics [13]. They also propose a rule-based scheme (PatchSNR) to combine these two classes of algorithms. In this paper, we test the underlying assumptions and show that many images might not be easily split into regions where internal methods or external methods are preferable. Instead we propose a learning based approach using a neural network, that automatically combines denoising results from an internal and from an external method. This approach outperforms both other combination methods and state-of-the-art stand-alone image denoising methods, hereby further closing the gap to the \u2026",

    "Description": "Climate extremes can affect the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, for instance via a reduction of the photosynthetic capacity or alterations of respiratory processes. Yet the dominant regional and seasonal effects of hydrometeorological extremes are still 5 not well documented. Here we quantify and characterize the role of large spatiotemporal extreme events in gross primary production (GPP) as triggers of continental anomalies. We also investigate seasonal dynamics of extreme impacts on continental GPP anomalies. We find that the 50 largest positive (increase in uptake) and negative extremes (decrease in uptake) on each continent can explain most of the continental 10 variation in GPP, which is in line with previous results obtained at the global scale. We show that negative extremes are larger than positive ones and demonstrate that this asymmetry is particularly strong in South America and Europe. Most extremes in GPP start in early summer. Our analysis indicates that the overall impacts and the spatial extents of GPP extremes are power law distributed with exponents that vary 15 little across continents. Moreover, we show that on all continents and for all data sets the spatial extents play a more important role than durations or maximal GPP anomaly when it comes to the overall impact of GPP extremes. An analysis of possible causes implies that across continents most extremes in GPP can best be explained by water scarcity rather than by extreme temperatures. However, for Europe, South America 20 and Oceania we identify also fire as an important driver. Our findings are consistent with remote sensing products. An independent \u2026",

Experimental data may exhibit substantial overdispersion, which may result from non-stationarity in the behaviour of observers. Here we extend the standard binomial model which is typically used for psychometric function estimation to a beta-binomial model. We show that the use of the beta-binomial model makes it possible to determine accurate credible intervals even in data which exhibit substantial overdispersion.

The abundance of data allows us to address both of these without using explicit image or blur priors. The end result is a simple but effective algorithm with no hyperparameters. We apply this algorithm to real-world images from astronomy and to super resolution tasks: for both, our algorithm yields increased resolution and deconvolved images simultaneously.",

    "Description": "Image denoising can be described as the problem of mapping from a noisy image to a noise-free image. The best currently available denoising methods approximate this mapping with cleverly engineered algorithms. In this work we attempt to learn this mapping directly with plain multi layer perceptrons (MLP) applied to image patches. We will show that by training on large image databases we are able to outperform the current state-of-the-art image denoising methods. In addition, our method achieves results that are superior to one type of theoretical bound and goes a large way toward closing the gap with a second type of theoretical bound. Our approach is easily adapted to less extensively studied types of noise, such as mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise, JPEG artifacts, salt-and-pepper noise and noise resembling stripes, for which we achieve excellent results as well. We will show that combining a block-matching procedure with MLPs can further improve the results on certain images. In a second paper, we detail the training trade-offs and the inner mechanisms of our MLPs.\nSubjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs. CV); Machine Learning (cs.

For our kTDSEP algorithm we have to go through four steps:(i) adapting to the intrinsic dimension of the data mapped to feature space F,(ii) finding an orthonormal basis of this submanifold,(iii) mapping the data into the subspace of F spanned by this orthonormal basis, and (iv) applying temporal decorrelation BSS (TDSEP) to the mapped data. After demixing we get a number of irrelevant components and the original sources. To find out which ones are the components of interest, we propose a criterion that allows to identify the original sources. The excellent performance of kTDSEP is demonstrated in experiments on nonlinearly mixed speech data.",

In particular, we are interested in the question whether it is helpful to exploit the shape information of the missing regions, i.e. the masks, which is something commonly ignored by other approaches. In comprehensive experiments on various images, we demonstrate that our learning-based approach is able to use this extra information and can achieve state-of-the-art inpainting results. Furthermore, we show that training with such extra information is useful for blind inpainting, where the exact shape of the missing region might be uncertain, for instance due to aliasing effects.",

    "Description": "Camera lenses are a critical component of optical imaging systems, and lens imperfections compromise image quality. While traditionally, sophisticated lens design and quality control aim at limiting optical aberrations, recent works [1,2,3] promote the correction of optical flaws by computational means. These approaches rely on elaborate measurement procedures to characterize an optical system, and perform image correction by non-blind deconvolution.\nIn this paper, we present a method that utilizes physically plausible assumptions to estimate non-stationary lens aberrations blindly, and thus can correct images without knowledge of specifics of camera and lens. The blur estimation features a novel preconditioning step that enables fast deconvolution. We obtain results that are competitive with state-of-the-art non-blind approaches.",

This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently: the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only few of them image collections have been formed and suitably annotated. To tackle the problem we introduce attribute-based classification: objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be pre-learned independently, eg from existing image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new \u2026",

    "Description": "As this book demonstrates, the development of efficient probabilistic inference techniques has made considerable progress in recent years, in particular with respect to exploiting the structure (eg, factored, hierarchical or relational) of discrete and continuous problem domains. In this chapter we show that these techniques can be used also for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) or partial observable MDPs (POMDPs) when formulated in terms of a structured dynamic Bayesian network (DBN).\nThe problems of planning in stochastic environments and inference in state space models are closely related, in particular in view of the challenges both of them face: scaling to large state spaces spanned by multiple state variables, or realizing planning (or inference) in continuous or mixed continuous-discrete state spaces. Both fields developed techniques to address these problems. For instance, in the field of planning, they include work on Factored Markov Decision Processes (Boutilier et al., 1995; Koller and Parr, 1999; Guestrin et al., 2003; Kveton and Hauskrecht, 2005), abstractions (Hauskrecht et al., 1998), and relational models of the environment (Zettlemoyer et al., 2005). On the other hand, recent advances in inference techniques show how structure can be exploited both for exact inference as well as making efficient approximations. Examples are message passing algorithms (loopy Belief Propagation, Expectation Propagation), variational approaches, approximate belief representations (particles, Assumed Density Filtering, Boyen-Koller) and arithmetic compilation (see, eg, Minka, 2001; Murphy, 2002; Chavira et al., 2006).

This paper presents a novel approach for denoising astronomical images that have been corrupted by dark-current noise. Our method relies on a probabilistic description of the dark-current of each pixel of a given camera. The noise model is then combined with an image prior which is adapted to astronomical images. In a laboratory environment, we use a black and white CCD camera containing a cooling unit and show that our method is superior to existing methods in terms of root mean squared error. Furthermore, we show that our method is practically relevant by providing visually more appealing results on astronomical photographs taken \u2026",

This paper explores various approaches to this problem and evaluates them on controlled data sets. Comprehensive experiments will show that model selection scores based on stability are not useful, while scores based on Gaussian processes are helpful for the NLDR problem.",

    "Description": "The variational Bayesian nonlinear blind source separation method introduced by Lappalainen and Honkela in 2000 is initialised with linear principal component analysis (PCA). Because of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network used to model the nonlinearity, the method is susceptible to local minima and therefore sensitive to the initialisation used. As the method is used for nonlinear separation, the linear initialisation may in some cases lead it astray. In this paper we study the use of kernel PCA (KPCA) in the initialisation. KPCA is a rather straightforward generalisation of linear PCA and it is much faster to compute than the variational Bayesian method. The experiments show that it can produce significantly better initialisations than linear PCA. Additionally, the model comparison methods provided by the variational Bayesian framework can be easily applied to compare different kernels.",

    "Description": "Psychometric functions are frequently used in vision science to model task performance. These sigmoid functions can be fit to data using likelihood maximization, but this ignores the reliability or variance of the point estimates. In contrast Bayesian methods automatically calculate this reliability. However, using Bayesian methods in practice usually requires expert knowledge, user interaction and computation time. Also most methods---including Bayesian ones---are vulnerable to non-stationary observers (whose performance is not constant). For such observers all methods, which assume a stationary binomial observer are overconfident in the estimates. We present Psignifit 4, a new method for fitting psychometric functions, which provides an efficient Bayesian analysis based on numerical integration, which requires little user-interaction and runs in seconds on a common office computer. Additionally it fits a beta-binomial model increasing the stability against non-stationarity and contains standard settings including a heuristic to set the prior based on the interval of stimulus levels in the experimental data. Obviously all properties of the analysis can be adjusted. To test our method it was run on extensive simulated datasets. First we tested the numerical accuracy of our method with different settings and found settings which calculate a good estimate fast and reliably. Testing the statistical properties, we find that our method calculates correct or slightly conservative confidence intervals in all tested conditions, including different sampling schemes, beta-binomial observers, other non-stationary observers and adaptive methods.

Its high resolution allows the study of laminar and columnar patterns of cell distributions, which build an important basis for the simulation of cortical areas and networks. However, such cytoarchitectonic mapping is a semiautomatic, time consuming process that does not scale with high throughput imaging. We present an automatic approach for parcellating histological sections at 2\u03bcm resolution. It is based on a convolutional neural network that combines topological information from probabilistic atlases with the texture features learned from high-resolution cell-body stained images. The model is applied to visual areas and trained on a sparse set of partial annotations. We show how predictions are transferable to new brains and spatially consistent across sections.",

Previous techniques focused on estimating alpha mattes for separating sharp, non-moving foreground objects from fairly homogeneous background. In those cases the only pixels which are ambiguous are those which exhibit fractional pixel occupancy. In this paper, we address the problem of alpha matte and foreground estimation of motion blurred objects. We show, that explicit modeling of the object motion facilitates the estimation and improves the quality of the estimated alpha mattes. In addition, we improve foreground extraction of motion blurred objects with a new regularization term. This task is particularly difficult in smeared out regions, where the background shimmers through. Both synthetic and real-world examples illustrate the merit of our approach.",

Such images can easily occur with modern cameras, when the auto-focus aims mistakenly at the background (which will appear sharp) instead of the foreground, where usually the object of interest is. In this paper we propose an automatic procedure that (i) estimates the amount of out-of-focus blur, (ii) segments the image into foreground and background incorporating clues from the blurriness, (iii) recovers the sharp foreground, and finally (iv) blurs the background to refocus the scene. On several real photographs with blurry foreground and sharp background, we demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of our method.",

The de-facto standard involves a semi-automatic, reproducible border detection, but does not scale with high-throughput imaging in large series of sections at microscopical resolution. Automatic parcellation, however, is extremely challenging due to high variation in the data, and the need for a large field of view at microscopic resolution. The performance of a recently proposed Convolutional Neural Network model that addresses this problem especially suffers from the naturally limited amount of expert annotations for training. To circumvent this limitation, we propose to pre-train neural networks on a self-supervised auxiliary task, predicting the 3D distance between two \u2026",

In this white paper, we argue that image modeling--fitting the Kepler-downlinked raw pixel data--can vastly improve the precision of Kepler in pointing-degraded two-wheel mode. We argue that a non-trivial modeling effort may permit continuance of photometry at 10-ppm-level precision. We demonstrate some baby steps towards precise models in both data-driven (flexible) and physics-driven (interpretably parameterized) modes. We demonstrate that the expected drift or jitter in positions in the two-weel era will help with constraining calibration parameters. In particular, we show that we can infer the device flat-field at higher than pixel resolution; that is, we can infer pixel-to-pixel variations in intra-pixel sensitivity. These results are relevant to almost any scientific goal for the repurposed mission; image modeling ought to be a part of any two-wheel repurpose for the satellite. We make other recommendations for Kepler operations, but fundamentally advocate that the project stick with its core mission of finding and characterizing Earth analogs.[abridged]",

In all cases the equation of motion for the state vector was known exactly. The fast dissipative magnetization dynamics is often investigated by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism movies (XMCD movies), which are often very noisy. In this situation the number of components of the state vector is extremely large (about 105), and the equation of motion for the dissipative magnetization dynamics (especially the values of the material parameters of this equation) is not well known.

In this contribution, we show that the learned features encode distinctive cytoarchitectonic attributes of the input patches, and form anatomically relevant clusters across the brain.",

Because the two-wheel performance of Kepler remains to be determined, we advocate for the consideration of an alternate strategy for a> 1 year program that maximizes the science return from the\" low-torque\" fields across the ecliptic plane. Assuming we can reach the precision of the original Kepler mission, we expect to detect 800 new planet candidates in the first year of such a mission. Our proposed strategy has benefits for transit timing variation and transit duration variation studies, especially when considered in concert with the future TESS mission.

In particular, we need a precise understanding of the impact of extreme events on the terrestrial biosphere in order to quantify the relevance for, and feedbacks with, the climate system. Previous studies have shown that climate extremes may have severe regional effects on the carbon cycle, but a state--of--the--art global impact assessment is still lacking. Hence, we quantify the impact of extreme anomalies in the state of vegetation on the global gross primary productivity (GPP). Using a definition of less than 5% chance of occurrence, we estimate that the 100 largest extreme events experienced by the terrestrial biosphere over the last 30 years are responsible for a decrease in carbon uptake of about 30 Pg C. We find that most extremes are best explainable by phases \u2026",

Because of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network used to model the nonlinearity, the method is susceptible to local minima and therefore sensitive to the initialisation used. As the method is used for nonlinear separation, the linear initialisation may in some cases lead it astray. In this report we study using kernel PCA (KPCA) to initialise NFA. KPCA is a rather straightforward generalisation of linear PCA and it is much faster to compute than NFA. The experiments show that it may produce significantly better initialisations than linear PCA, although finding a suitable kernel and parameters may be difficult.",
