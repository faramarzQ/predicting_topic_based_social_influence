Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge \u2026", "Total citations": "Cited by 284\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019", "Scholar articles": "A bayesian approach to discovering truth from conflicting sources for data integration\nB Zhao, BIP Rubinstein, J Gemmell, J Han - Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2012\nCited by 284 Related articles All 16 versions"}, {"title": "ANTIDOTE: Understanding and defending against poisoning of anomaly detectors", "Authors": "Benjamin IP Rubinstein, Blaine Nelson, Ling Huang, Anthony D Joseph, Shing-hon Lau, Satish Rao, Nina Taft, JD Tygar", "Publication date": "2009/11/4", "Conference": "Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference", "Pages": "1-14", "Publisher": "ACM", "Description": "Statistical machine learning techniques have recently garnered increased popularity as a means to improve network design and security. For intrusion detection, such methods build a model for normal behavior from training data and detect attacks as deviations from that model. This process invites adversaries to manipulate the training data so that the learned model fails to detect subsequent attacks.\nWe evaluate poisoning techniques and develop a defense, in the context of a particular anomaly detector-namely the PCA-subspace method for detecting anomalies in backbone networks. For three poisoning schemes, we show how attackers can substantially increase their chance of successfully evading detection by only adding moderate amounts of poisoned data. Moreover such poisoning throws off the balance between false positives and false negatives thereby dramatically reducing the efficacy of the detector.", "Total citations": "Cited by 192\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019", "Scholar articles": "Antidote: understanding and defending against poisoning of anomaly detectors\nBIP Rubinstein, B Nelson, L Huang, AD Joseph, S Lau\u2026 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM conference on \u2026, 2009\nCited by 192 Related articles All 13 versions"}, {"title": "Learning in a large function space: Privacy-preserving mechanisms for SVM learning", "Authors": "Benjamin IP Rubinstein, Peter L Bartlett, Ling Huang, Nina Taft", "Publication date": "2012/8/16", "Journal": "Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality", "Volume": "4", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "65-100", "Description": "Several recent studies in privacy-preserving learning have considered the trade-off between utility or risk and the level of differential privacy guaranteed by mechanisms for statistical query processing. In this paper we study this trade-off in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We present two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional feature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings with translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant kernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the desired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale learning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the classifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension. Differential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic stability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise epsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by appealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower bound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM. This negative result states that for any delta, no mechanism can be simultaneously (epsilon, delta)-useful and beta-differentially private for small epsilon and small beta.", "Total citations": "Cited by 156\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019", "Scholar articles": "Learning in a large function space: Privacy-preserving mechanisms for SVM learning\nBIP Rubinstein, PL Bartlett, L Huang, N Taft - arXiv preprint arXiv:0911.5708, 2009\nCited by 156 Related articles All 9 versions"}, {"title": "Exploiting Machine Learning to Subvert Your Spam Filter.", "Authors": "Blaine Nelson, Marco Barreno, Fuching Jack Chi, Anthony D Joseph, Benjamin IP Rubinstein, Udam Saini, Charles A Sutton, J Doug Tygar, Kai Xia", "Publication date": "2008/4/15", "Conference": "First USENIX Workshop on Large-scale Exploits and Emergent Threats (LEET'08)", "Volume": "8", "Pages": "1-9", "Description": "Using statistical machine learning for making security decisions introduces new vulnerabilities in large scale systems.

While maximum classes (concept classes meeting Sauer's Lemma with equality) can be compressed, the compression of general concept classes reduces to compressing maximal classes (classes that cannot be expanded without increasing VC dimension). Two promising ways forward are: embedding maximal classes into maximum classes with at most a polynomial increase to VC dimension, and compression via operating on geometric representations. This paper presents positive results on the latter approach and a first negative result on the former, through a systematic investigation of finite maximum classes. Simple arrangements of hyperplanes in hyperbolic space are shown to represent maximum classes, generalizing the corresponding Euclidean result. We show that sweeping a generic hyperplane across such arrangements forms an unlabeled compression scheme of size VC dimension and corresponds to a special case of peeling the one-inclusion graph, resolving a recent conjecture of Kuzmin & Warmuth. A bijection between finite maximum classes and certain arrangements of piecewise-linear (PL) hyperplanes in either a ball or Euclidean space is established. Finally we show that d-maximum classes corresponding to PL-hyperplane arrangements in \u211d d have cubical complexes homeomorphic to a d-ball, or equivalently complexes that are manifolds with boundary. A main result is that PL arrangements can be swept by a moving hyperplane to unlabeled d-compress any finite maximum class, forming a peeling scheme as \u2026", "Total citations": "Cited by 34\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018", "Scholar articles": "A geometric approach to sample compression\nBIP Rubinstein, JH Rubinstein - Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2012\nCited by 34 Related articles All 13 versions"}, {"title": "A game theoretical approach to defend against co-resident attacks in cloud computing: Preventing co-residence using semi-supervised learning", "Authors": "Yi Han, Tansu Alpcan, Jeffrey Chan, Christopher Leckie, Benjamin IP Rubinstein", "Publication date": "2015/12/4", "Journal": "IEEE Transactions on information Forensics and Security", "Volume": "11", "Issue": "3", "Pages": "556-570", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Description": "While cloud computing has facilitated easy and affordable access to IT resources, it has also introduced a wide range of security risks from almost every layer and component of cloud systems.

Measurement theory from education and psychology provides statistical models for quantifying a person's attainment of intangible attributes such as attitudes, abilities or intelligence. Such models infer latent skill levels by relating them to individuals' observed responses on a series of items such as quiz questions. The set of items can be used to measure a latent skill if individuals' responses on them conform to a Guttman scale. Such well-scaled items differentiate between individuals and inferred levels span the entire range from most basic to the advanced. In practice, education researchers manually devise items (quiz questions) while optimising well-scaled conformance. Due to the costly nature and expert requirements of this process, psychometric testing has found limited use in everyday teaching. We aim to develop usable measurement models for highly-instrumented MOOC delivery platforms, by using participation in automatically-extracted online forum topics as items. The challenge is to formalise the Guttman scale educational constraint and incorporate it into topic models. To favour topics that automatically conform to a Guttman scale, we introduce a novel regularisation into non-negative matrix factorisation-based topic modelling.

But when past inferences guide future inquiries into the same dataset, reaching valid inferences becomes significantly more difficult. In addition to avoiding the overfitting that can result from adaptive analysis, a data analyst often wants to use as little time and data as possible. A recent line of work in the theory community has established mechanisms that provide low generalization error on adaptive queries, yet there remain large gaps between established theoretical results and how data analysis is done in practice. Many practitioners, for instance, successfully employ bootstrapping and related sampling approaches in order to maintain validity and speed up analysis, but prior to this work, no theoretical analysis existed to justify employing such techniques in this adaptive setting.\nIn this paper, we show how these techniques can be used to provably guarantee validity while speeding up analysis. Through this investigation, we initiate the study of sub-linear time mechanisms to answer adaptive queries into datasets. Perhaps surprisingly, we describe mechanisms that provide an exponential speed-up per query over previous mechanisms, without needing to increase the total amount of data needed for low generalization error. We also provide a method for achieving statistically-meaningful responses even when the mechanism is only allowed to see a constant number of samples from the data per query.\nSubjects: Machine Learning (cs.

From collected noisy worker labels, aggregation models that incorporate worker reliability parameters aim to infer a latent true annotation. In this paper, we argue that existing crowdsourcing approaches do not sufficiently model worker correlations observed in practical settings; we propose in response an enhanced Bayesian classifier combination (EBCC) model, with inference based on a mean-field variational approach. An introduced mixture of intra-class reliabilities\u2014connected to tensor decomposition and item clustering\u2014induces inter-worker correlation. EBCC does not suffer the limitations of existing correlation models: intractable marginalisation of missing labels and poor scaling to large worker cohorts. Extensive empirical comparison on 17 real-world datasets sees EBCC achieving the highest mean accuracy across 10 benchmark crowdsourcing methods.", "Scholar articles": "Exploiting Worker Correlation for Label Aggregation in Crowdsourcing\nY Li, B Rubinstein, T Cohn - International Conference on Machine Learning, 2019\nRelated articles"}, {"title": "Adversarial Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability in Software-Defined Networking", "Authors": "Yi Han, David Hubczenko, Paul Montague, Olivier De Vel, Tamas Abraham, Benjamin IP Rubinstein, Christopher Leckie, Tansu Alpcan, Sarah Erfani", "Publication date": "2019/2/25", "Journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09062", "Description": "Recent studies have demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) agents are susceptible to adversarial manipulation, similar to vulnerabilities previously demonstrated in the supervised setting.

We demonstrate that causative attacks---attacks that target the training process---can poison RL agents even if the attacker only has partial observability of the environment. In addition, we propose an inversion defence method that aims to apply the opposite perturbation to that which an attacker might use to generate their adversarial samples.

Research into models of annotation aggregation attempts to infer a latent'true'annotation, which has been shown to improve the utility of crowd-sourced data. However, existing techniques beat simple baselines only in low redundancy settings, where the number of annotations per instance is low (= 3), or in situations where workers are unreliable and produce low quality annotations (eg, through spamming, random, or adversarial behaviours.)

We develop a generalpurpose \u201cplug and play\u201d framework for gradient-based attacks based on matrix differentials, focusing on ordinary least-squares linear regression. This allows learning algorithms and data transformations to be paired and composed arbitrarily: attacks can be adapted through the use of the chain rule\u2014analogous to backpropagation on neural network parameters\u2014to compositional learning maps. Best-response attacks can be computed through matrix multiplications from a library of attack matrices for transformations and learners. Our treatment of linear regression extends state-of-the-art attacks at training time, by permitting the attacker to affect both features and targets optimally and simultaneously. We explore several transformations broadly used across machine learning with a driving motivation for our work being autogressive modeling. There, Bob transforms a univariate time series into a matrix of observations and vector of target values which can then be fed into standard learners. Under this learning reduction, a perturbation from Alice to a single value of the time series affects features of several data points along with target values.", "Scholar articles": "Attacking Data Transforming Learners at Training Time\nS Alfeld, A Vartanian, L Newman-Johnson\u2026 - 2019\nRelated articles All 2 versions"}, {"title": "Fast Manifold Landmarking Using Locality-Sensitive Hashing", "Authors": "Zay Maung Maung Aye, Benjamin IP Rubinstein, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao", "Publication date": "2018/6/3", "Conference": "Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "Pages": "452-464", "Publisher": "Springer, Cham", "Description": "Manifold landmarks can approximately represent the low-dimensional nonlinear manifold structure embedded in high-dimensional ambient feature space.

The Rasch model from psychometrics is a popular generative probabilistic model that relates latent student skill, latent item difficulty, and observed student-item responses within a principled, unified framework. According to scholarly educational theory, discovered topics can be regarded as appropriate measurement items if (1) students' participation across the discovered topics is well fit by the Rasch model, and if (2) the topics are interpretable to subject-matter experts as being educationally meaningful. Such Rasch-scaled topics, with associated difficulty levels, could be of potential benefit to curriculum refinement, student assessment and personalised feedback. The technical challenge that remains, is to discover meaningful topics that simultaneously achieve good statistical fit with the Rasch model. To address this challenge, we combine the Rasch model with non-negative matrix factorisation based topic modelling, jointly fitting both models.
